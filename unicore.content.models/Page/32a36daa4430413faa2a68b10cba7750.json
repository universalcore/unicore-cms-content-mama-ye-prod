  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA I had a long labour and a difficult delivery. I needed\nstitches for a tear. Once or twice I\u2019ve leaked a small amount of urine when\nI\u2019ve sneezed. The nurses told me to practice squeezing my muscles as if trying\nto stop the flow of urine. Now I practise doing this every time my baby feeds\nso that I don\u2019t forget. It\u2019s been a few weeks now and I\u2019m starting to fit into\nsome of my old clothes again. I have lost some of the pregnancy weight. But I\nstill don\u2019t feel the way I did before. I look at myself in the mirror and see\na dark line down my belly and stretch marks. The skin over my belly still\nfeels loose and soft. My husband says I still look good, but I\u2019m not so sure.\nI feel older\u2026 and tired! I know my body is healing and recovering from the\nbirth. I look at my beautiful child and I think it was all worth it to have\nhim. But I didn\u2019t expect to feel so different! I suppose I AM different\u2026 I\u2019m a\nmother now. MAMA HELP: The postpartum (after birth) period lasts from right\nafter the delivery to 8 weeks after you\u2019ve given birth. Your body is healing\nfrom the pregnancy and birth. You will go back to the clinic for a check up\nafter 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n",
