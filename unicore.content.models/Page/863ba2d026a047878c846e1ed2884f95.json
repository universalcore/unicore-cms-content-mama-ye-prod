  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA At the hospital my baby did not cry much. It started\nwhen we got home. She cried right through that first night. I was\nbreastfeeding her fine, I had no problem with that. I knew which positions to\nuse. The nurses had shown me at the clinic. But she just cried all night,\nevery night. She would sleep all day and cry all night. I came to fear the\nnights. She screamed like she was in pain. I couldn\u2019t leave her alone. I sat\nwith her all night. It would tear my heart apart. I thought I would go mad\nfrom lack of sleep. Other moms tell me I should have done things differently.\nI should have kept her awake during the day to make her more tired at night.\nOr I should have just left her to cry. But I was 18 at the time and I just did\nthe best I could. Then when she reached 6 months, the crying stopped. That was\nthe first time I started to enjoy being a mother! She turns 2 this year and\nshe is doing well! And I am doing well. The early days were hard. But we both\ngot through it all okay! MAMA HELP: Every baby is different, but all babies\ncry. Listening to your baby cry for hours can make you worried, even angry.\nYou may not be able to stop her from crying. But stay calm and do your best to\nsoothe her until she settles down. If you know she is not hungry, tired, wet\nor in pain, get a second opinion from someone you trust. Together you can\ndecide if your baby needs to see a doctor.\n\n",
